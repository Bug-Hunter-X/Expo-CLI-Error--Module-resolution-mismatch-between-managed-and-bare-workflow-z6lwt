The solution depends on the specific error, but generally involves refactoring your code to align with the chosen Expo workflow. Here's a conceptual example:

**Problem:** Attempting to use an Expo managed module (e.g., `expo-location`) in a bare workflow.

**Solution:**
1. **Eject from managed workflow (if applicable):**  If you started with a managed workflow, you might need to consider ejecting if you require more control.  This is a major change. (See expo documentation).
2. **Use React Native modules directly:** Instead of relying on Expo-specific modules, use the equivalent React Native modules (if they exist). For example, instead of `expo-location`, use the React Native `react-native-geolocation-service` library which needs to be installed with `expo install react-native-geolocation-service` or `yarn add react-native-geolocation-service`.
3. **Manual installation and linking:** If necessary, manually install and link native modules for your bare workflow following the instructions provided by each module.
4. **Adjust imports:** Ensure your import statements correctly reflect the location of modules in your project.  Be very careful about this step. For bare workflow you would require to change your imports to use bare workflow versions of expo modules, or use different modules that are compatible with bare workflow.
